### Introduction

#### This README provides an overview of the Health App Admin Dashboard, its features, and instructions on how to use it effectively.
Features

#### Management: 
The admin dashboard allows administrators to easily handle user accounts. They can see user profiles, change user details, and deal with requests like deleting accounts or resetting passwords. Administrators can also check and say yes to new user sign-ups.

#### Appointment Management:
Admins can manage the appointment system and make changes as needed. They can see future appointments, change their timing or cancel them, and deal with any problems in the schedule. The dashboard also shows a summary of past appointments for reference and making reports.

#### Doctor Access: 
Doctors can log in to the admin dashboard using their own information and use a few features. They can check their appointment schedules, change when they're available, and handle patient records for their practice. The admin dashboard only lets them do things related to their practice and doesn't allow access to important admin tasks.

### Conclusion

The Health App Admin Dashboard gives administrators and doctors the tools they need to run the health app effectively. With these features, administrators can make sure users have a good experience, simplify appointment scheduling, and keep the health app working smoothly.
